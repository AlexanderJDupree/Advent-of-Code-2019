# Advent or Code 2019 : Solutions in Haskell

This repo contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge for 2019. This year I decided to get of my comfort zone and attempt the challenge in Haskell. 

## Organization

The `app/Main.hs` is the driver that prints the solutions the terminal. The actual code is stored in the `src` folder, and each with the file named for the specific days challenge. I also used the `Hspec` library to test out my solutions. You can run the unit tests with `stack test` and run the main driver with `stack run`.

## Goals

My goals for this challenge is:

- Provide a correct solution with reasonable runtimes for each day of the challenge
- Complete the challenge before the new year. 
- Gain a better understanding of functional programming, and problem solving in Haskell
